        If you're all ready to join us in person, that's great! Practice takes
        place on most Thursday nights, 7pm - 9pm at the Fostoria
        Elementary Bandroom. Please park in the rear parking lot, to the north
        of the elementary school building, west of the Junior High/Highschool building.
        The band breaks from practice after certain concerts, so

        ongoing, or to see when practice will begin next.
